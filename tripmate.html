							<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
							
							<h3>Responsive Website</h3>
							<p>

								The tech stack our team has decided to use for the responsive web-site will consist of React js in combination with Redux for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end side of things. The motivation behind using React as our main front-end tool is due to the support and documentation Facebook provides. The React documentation is extremely easy to grasp, even having a walkthrough of how to create a small React application, highlighting all the main concepts of the framework. Hand-in-hand with documentation is the vast community support, with the Github repository having over 1300 contributors and a large community helping to address common questions on Stack Overflow.
								
								<br><br>Furthermore, starting a React project requires very little start-up time as Facebook has put together a Node module called create-react-app that will get us started by simply running a single command. Additionally, in order to be successful in this project, we will need to develop in an efficient manner. React js helps on this front with the ease of modularization. React is highly focused on creating reusable components within the system, allowing us to generalize our UI components and reuse them across our application.
								
								<br><br>We have decided to pair Redux with React for our front-end. The main motivation behind this is the ease of managing state. With React’s ability to turn the UI various components, managing the state can become difficult if not impossible as the application grows. Using Redux will allow us to manage our state from a top-level centralized place, ensuring we have one source of truth when dealing with manipulating and displaying our data to the users. Redux also works well for a RESTFUL API design, which we plan to use as the architecture for our backend.
								
								<br><br>Finally, we have chosen Express.js as the framework for our back-end server. The reasoning behind this choice is that it abstracts away a lot of the low-level details that we are not concerned with for this project. We are able to quickly specify API routes with a robust set of features for web applications. Express and a RESTFUL architecture go hand-in-hand with express providing a plethora of HTTP utility methods and middleware for quick back-end development. Express is also a Node js framework giving us the opportunity to take advantage of the millions of community-made node modules to aid in our development. Lastly, Express.js has a low learning curve with the added benefit of having tons of examples in their documentation, likely allowing us to spend less time learning the framework and more time on feature development.
							</p>
							<h3>Mobile Application</h3>
							<p>
								We have chosen React Native as our mobile application technology stack. First of all, there is less work involved since we only need one code base for two different platforms. React Native compiles to native Java and Swift code for Android and IOS devices respectively. Specifically, it creates a bridge between web UI components and the native Java/Swift counterparts. Thus, there is no need for two development teams independently responsible for two platforms and no need to synchronize features and layouts. This will enable us to simply develop faster.
								
								<br><br>Secondly, React Native is easy to learn in a short amount of time. This is a huge benefit since this project requires us to be hands-on very quickly and start delivering a valuable product soon. Also, there is less specialized knowledge needed to create React Native apps. Considering that our group has more experience in JavaScript than Swift, even if we’ve never used React Native, with some self-education we can get up to speed quickly, especially if we’ve used React js already. All we need is a little time googling to find out which web components correspond with which mobile components, and then we’re all set.
								
								<br><br>Additionally, React Native works nicely with React js. Since we have chosen to implement our web client using React js, fragments of the frontend code can be shared between mobile and web, further facilitating the software development process.
								
								<br><br>Last but not least, there are lots of tutorials and videos about how to start a React Native app or resolve certain issues. This means we are less likely to get stuck indefinitely or consider switching to another language due to regret. 
								
								In summary, being an easy to use framework that will require less work, has detailed documentation, and reduces stress when developing full stack with React js, React Native is a good option for us.
							</p>
							<h3>Database</h3>
							<p>

								For our database layer, we have elected to use the NoSQL database, MongoDB. The primary motivation in using Mongo is how quick it is to get running and use. Like the rest of the technologies previously discussed in this document, MongoDB is included in the Node Package Manager. A simple ‘npm install mongodb’ will allow us to add MongoDB, abstracting any other installation needs. Once a new developer starts working with the project an npm build will install all tech stack dependencies - all they need is Node on their computers. In terms of use, MongoDB does not store/retrieve values in the table/column/row model of a relational database.  Instead, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. The benefit of this approach is objects are mapped directly to application code, making data easy to work with and easy to scale. 
								
								<br><br>One feature we are looking to implement is providing the user with recommendations on places to eat/shop and events to see. Geospatial queries on SQL databases can be very challenging because of how fast/often data can change. MongoDB has built-in geospatial features, allowing for our app to be responsive to changes in user location without using excessive resources from our server.
								
								<br><br>MongoDB is highly documented and has many tutorials online. In the event we get stuck or do not know where to start we can quickly refer to said documentation and tutorials. This will reduce our time playing around or researching for fixes.

							<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
							<h3>What did you learn about team or large project development?</h3>
							<P>Throughout this project, we learned the importance of many aspects of large project
								development such as continuous deployment, continuous integration, interactive
								rebasing, formal planning activities (eg. Trello), linters, merge/pull requests and
								communication. Using Github as version control allowed us to create pull requests,
								where 3 other group members had to approve first before merging to the development
								branch. This was an effective strategy in only merging working code and keeping other
								group members in the loop about your progress.
								<br><br>
								Also, our group was able to implement continuous integration and continuous
								development. So, when regularly occurring pull requests were merged with the
								development branch, automated testing, linting and deployment occurred. This saved
								our group a tremendous amount of time for two reasons. First, since there was
								automated testing and linting, you were able to quickly determine if the code to be
								merged was functional and meeting coding conventions. This made reviewing code on
								Github much easier because you knew the code was tested and readable. Second,
								since there was automated deployment, we were able to continuously have an updated
								EC2 instance with the state of our application. This eliminated the worry of having
								trouble getting a working version of our application deployed. In addition, this saved so
								much time as there were more than 80 automated deployments of our application.
								<br><br>
								Lastly, using Trello allowed our group to remain on task and get a high-level view of the
								state of our application. On Trello, we decided to have a list of tickets that reflected what
								needed to be completed for the MVP. Then, group members would be able to
								continuously pull from this list of tickets so that we were continuously making progress.
								With each ticket, you’d be able to see who was working on it and what stage this feature
								was at in development. This allowed anyone to look at our Trello board and see a
								snapshot of what was happening in the development of our application. Moreover,
								interactive rebasing was a workflow decision that further increased the readability of our
								development branch. This is when you rebase your branch onto development and
								squash all of your commits into one. The result is a fluid, clean, reversible git history that
								further emphasizes the readability of our progress.</P>
							<h1>The Future of Tripmate</h1>
								<h3>If we kept working on the project, what would we do next?</h3>

								<p>If development on Tripmate were to continue, there is a set of immediate goals as well
								as some stretch goals that would help carve out a market niche. The immediate tasks
								are more conventional for trip planning apps but would help improve the overall usability
								of the app. For instance, calendar integration would help make events and travel times
								visible at a glance, and notifications would remind the user of incomplete to-do lists and
								upcoming events. In case some bookings are made or confirmed on paper, it would be
								great to have the option of linking pictures or pdfs with the bookings in the app. This
								would help round out Tripmate’s ability to centralize all trip information.
								We would also like to add event recommendations to the app through the use of the
								EventBrite external API, similar to our use of external APIs for finding available hotels.
								Support for finding and booking rental vehicles would also be a great addition. Since
								internet access is not always a guarantee when travelling, another task would be adding
								a local database to the mobile app that can be synced periodically with the “master”
								remote one.
								<br><br>
								In terms of stretch goals, we would love to expand Tripmate to include a variety of
								networking features. The first of these would be the ability to add other users to your
								trip. This would allow families, as an example, to plan a trip together with a shared
								itinerary and set of to-do lists. Following this, we would add wider community features,
								such as the ability to share, fork, and rate trip templates made by other users -- we’d
								take steps to make sure users cannot broadcast the specifics of their trips. This would
								be a great way for users to find low budget trip ideas or inspiration for grand adventures.
								We could also create our own proprietary services for automatically generating new trip
								templates as starting points for users based on their previous travels.
								Of course, as we dive into all of these additional features, we would like to refactor
								Tripmate to use a microservice architecture. Following the Law of Holes, going forward,
								all new features would be implemented as a microservice. Furthermore, old features
								would be refactored gradually, most likely one per each release. This way, our app can
								remain agile and scalable as it grows, which is vital since we clearly have a ton of ideas
								for the future of Tripmate.</p>
							
							<h1>Conclusion</h1>
							<p>Upon successfully completing the MVP for Tripmate, our team is left with a stronger
								understanding of not only numerous new technologies but also what it takes to harness
								these technologies effectively as a large team to build a robust baseline that has the
								potential to scale into a giant. From this team development process, we learned many
								lessons and each has our own personal takeaways, ranging from architecture
								considerations to team management practices, and we will employ these learnings in
								future large-scale projects. Lastly, implementing and deploying a product from start to
								finish using real-world technologies and workflows has served as a benchmark of what
								to expect in future software development endeavours.</p>
