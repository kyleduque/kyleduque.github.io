								Flashcards are a common and successful technique used by students to study and prepare for upcoming tests and examinations. However, using a physical medium introduces numerous potential issues and complications. Physical flashcards can be lost, forgotten, or damaged before they have exhausted their use. Losing a flashcard will lead to gaps in the knowledge gained from studying, which can result in both a frustrating experience and lost marks. In addition, having access to a wide variety of physical flashcards for multiple subjects necessitates the creation and maintenance of a physical filing system.
								
								<br><br>Our solution is an application for electronic flashcards that can be viewed anywhere. The application will maintain the function and utility of flashcards, while providing enhanced features that would not be possible with the physical alternative.
								
								<br><br>The application will help users create a robust library of flashcards for review by allowing them to create flashcards with various types of questions, as well as offering several tools for their management and organization. An example of the benefits this would provide is the ability to sort flashcards into decks, and those decks into various categories, which allows for greater efficiency while studying as well as flexibility between units and subjects. Options such as timed quizzes will help the user stay motivated throughout their study session and simulate the experience of an actual test by running through multiple questions in a limited amount of time. This introduces an objective measure of progress, along with an aspect of competitiveness that will engage the user to continue studying, helping transform a tedious activity into something fun and addicting.
								
								<br><br>This product is valuable because it will aid its users significantly in reviewing unfamiliar material, and preparing for exams, tests, and assignments. Additionally, since it will be developed for Android, it will be easily accessible to those who need it due to the popularity and ubiquity of the Android operating system. In addition, the application will attempt to rectify some of the problems that similar products have failed to address and in doing so, providing an improved user experience.
